👋 Hi, I’m Victor Kyalo
👀 I’m interested in software engineering and all things tech-related.
🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of software engineering.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and anything that challenges my coding skills.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to email me at vkyalo25@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-kyalo-b98764300/).
😄 Pronouns: he/him
⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote a program to teach my cat how to code. Suffice to say, it was more interested in napping than nested loops!
